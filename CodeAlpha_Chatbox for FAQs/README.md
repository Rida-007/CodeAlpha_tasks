Chatbot for FAQs
----------------
About the Project
SkillBuddy is an intelligent FAQ chatbot built using Python and Natural Language Processing (NLP). The chatbot is designed to answer user questions by matching them with the most relevant Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs).

It uses NLP techniques such as text preprocessing, tokenization, stopword removal, and cosine similarity to understand the user’s question and provide the best matching answer.

WORKING
-------
A set of questions and answers is stored in the system. Both user input and stored FAQs are preprocessed using NLTK. The text is converted into vectors using TF-IDF Vectorizer This allows the chatbot to compare sentences mathematically. The most similar question is selected using cosine similarity. The chatbot displays the answer of the best matching FAQ.
