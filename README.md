Project Overview
-----------------
This repository contains two main projects developed as part of my learning and exploration in Artificial Intelligence:
1.Language Translation Tool
2.Chatbot


Language Translation Tool
--------------------------
About the Project
------------------
The Language Translation Tool is a web-based application designed to help users translate text from one language to another quickly and easily. The main goal of this project was to create a simple, user-friendly interface where anyone can enter text, choose the desired languages, and get accurate translations instantly.

This project also understands how real-world applications interact with external APIs and handle user input effectively.

WORKING
-------
Enter or paste any text they want to translate
Select the source language
Select the target language
Click the Translate button

FEATURES
---------
Support for multiple languages
Real-time translation using Translation API
Translation history saving
Copy translated text option
Voice input (Speech-to-Text)
Listen to translated text (Text-to-Speech)
Clean and modern user interface


Chatbot for FAQs
-----------------
About the Project
------------------
SkillBuddy is an intelligent FAQ chatbot built using Python and Natural Language Processing (NLP). The chatbot is designed to answer user questions by matching them with the most relevant Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs).

It uses NLP techniques such as text preprocessing, tokenization, stopword removal, and cosine similarity to understand the user’s question and provide the best matching answer.

WORKING
-------
A set of questions and answers is stored in the system.
Both user input and stored FAQs are preprocessed using NLTK.
The text is converted into vectors using TF-IDF Vectorizer
This allows the chatbot to compare sentences mathematically.
The most similar question is selected using cosine similarity.
The chatbot displays the answer of the best matching FAQ.

FEATURES
--------
FAQ-based chatbot
Uses NLP preprocessing (NLTK)
Tokenization and stopword removal
Uses TF-IDF Vectorization
Uses Cosine Similarity
Fast and accurate response 
Simple and interactive chat interface
Easy to use
Lightweight project
